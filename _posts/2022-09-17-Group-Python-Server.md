My group and I created a github repo together and implemented that onto a python/flask server. You can see it running locally on my host below.

We each created our own page at the top, you can see a screenshot of my page below!

We also each edited the projects page, and you can see my projects page below. The links are to my fastpages and my github!

Every time we want to edit it, we must pull before pushing it to get the updated version!
