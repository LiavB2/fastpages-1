I have successfully ran my fastpages locally and I am able to see the changes immediately on my local server instead of first pushing it through github! Here is a screenshot of my fastpages running on my local server.

In the image above, you can see that the URL is not my permanent fastpages link, but it is my fastpages running on my local server at http://localhost:4000/fastpages/ which will not work on any other computer other than minie when I run it on my laptop.
