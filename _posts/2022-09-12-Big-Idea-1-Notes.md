### Notes on 1.1 Daily Video 1
- Collaboration is important because it produces a computing innovation that reflects the diversity+talents+perspectives of the people who worked together to design it
- A computing innovation includes a program as an important part of its function (can be physical or non-physical)
- Collaboration helps avoid bias
- The answer to the question in the video was B.

### Notes on 1.2 Daily Video 2
- Pair programming: one person is the "driver" who codes while the other person looks at each line of code as it is typed, switch back and forth!
- Think pair share: think about a problem alone, pair with a partner to share ideas, share with the class
- Leave comments in the code to make sure you know what you're doing, especially in the future
    - Acknowledge code/media used from other people/sources
- Collaboration tools: repl.it, github (what our APCSP class is using), shared doc/folder

### Collaboration Quiz
