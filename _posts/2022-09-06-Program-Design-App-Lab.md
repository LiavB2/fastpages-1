### Reveiw Running Example
The [incomplete program](https://studio.code.org/projects/applab/rEkq6_-HMk-W8WkN1WoZFm45pdGoioqK4ur9sYYve6Q) example could be improved because it only goes to the next question when you cick on the right answer, which is pretty confusing. If someone clicks the wrong answer, the quiz should move on and document that as a wrong answer. And then at the end, the quiz should display the score and percentage of the user.

### My Quiz Plan
Here is my quiz plan.

Quiz topic: foods
Number of questions: 5
Number of answers per question: 4

Here are the questions I plan to have and their corresponding answers:

Question 1: Which of the following foods can never go bad?
Answers: chocolate, hard candy, honey (correct), water

Question 2: What type of food holds the world record for being the most stolen around the globe?
Answers: rice, cheese (correct), waffles, noodles

Question 3: What type of food is the most frequently ordered item in the USA?
Answers: pizza, cheeseburger, hash browns, chicken (correct)

Question 4: What is the oldest soft drink in the United States?
Answers: Dr. Pepper (correct), Coke, Sprite, Fanta

Question 5: Where does chicken adobo originate?
Answers: Cambodia, Indonesia, Philippines (correct), Malaysia

### Console
Here is an image of me printing out a message to the console!
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/consoleapplab.jpg">
Answers to questions:
This message doesn't print in the app. It prints out in the debug console. This is useful because you can display important messages like errors to developers instead of the user. You can also use this to debug your code by not displaying it on the application.

### Elements
Something interesting I found was that you can create a button. You can keep track of all the elements you created by going to the Design tab and looking at the dropdown menus and your different screens. Another thing to keep in mind is to name your elements specifically so you know what element refers to what without having to go look at it each time, which is very time consuming. This also applies to any variables, you should name them specifically.

### Discoveries
One discovery that I had was that you can change screens and create variable. This is useful in a quiz because you need to move onto future questions, which requires the changing of screens, and you also need to keep track of the user score, which means variables are necessary.

### Challenges
Some challenges I had were that you couldn't copy paste the blocks, but then I learned that you can click the text button to go to the raw code. This was useful because I could copy paste the code to speed up my process.

### Successes
Some successes that I had were that I sucessfully created a 5-question food quiz, which tells you if you got the answer right or wrong after you click on an answer, and then at the end, it shows your score.
