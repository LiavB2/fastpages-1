### Hack #1: Changing Theme
Here are two screenshots as evidence that I changed the theme from minima to the midnight theme :)

### Hack #2: Time Box Fragments
Here is a link to [my commit history on Github](https://github.com/sophia926/fastpages/graphs/commit-activity)

### Hack #3: Naming/Tagging
I have incorporated naming and tagging into my fastpages blog because I have categories for hacks, posts, and setup.

### Hack #4: Search
I have considered the search feature because I name all my posts and notebooks with specific keywords and also tag them, so it is easy to find.
