### Hack #1: Changing Theme
Here are two screenshots as evidence that I changed the theme from minima to the midnight theme :)

### Hack #2: Time Box Fragments
Here is a link to [my commit history on Github](https://github.com/sophia926/fastpages/graphs/commit-activity)

### Hack #3: Naming/Tagging
I have incorporated naming and tagging into my fastpages blog because I have categories for hacks, posts, and setup.

### Hack #4: Search
I have considered the search feature because I name all my posts and notebooks with specific keywords and also tag them, so it is easy to find.

### Hack #5: Table
Here is my school schedule!
<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Period</th>
    <th>Course Title</th>
    <th>Room Name</th>
    <th>Teacher</th>
    <th>My Thoughts</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>AP Calculus AB</td>
    <td>L102</td>
    <td>Ms. Nydam</td>
    <td>Pretty fun in general</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>Honors Humanities</td>
    <td>G117</td>
    <td>Mrs. Philyaw</td>
    <td>Interesting studying meaning of aesthetics/art</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>AP World History 1</td>
    <td>L114</td>
    <td>Ms. Volger</td>
    <td>Actually better than I expected, one of my favorite classes</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>4</td>
    <td>AP CS Principles 1</td>
    <td>D103</td>
    <td>Mr. Yeung</td>
    <td>Different than I expected, but pretty chill</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>5</td>
    <td>AP Chemistry 4</td>
    <td>K104</td>
    <td>Mrs. Callicott</td>
    <td>I liked the first two labs that we have done!</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Hack #6: Dark Mode
I have changed my site to dark mode, which you can see!
