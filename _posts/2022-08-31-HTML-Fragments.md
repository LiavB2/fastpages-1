### Hack #1: Changing Theme
Here are two screenshots as evidence that I changed the theme from minima to the midnight theme :)

### Hack #2: Time Box Fragments
Here is a link to [my commit history on Github](https://github.com/sophia926/fastpages/graphs/commit-activity). You can see all the commits I have done, with comments on what they exactly do. It shows that I am continuously updating my blog and making progress!
You can also see a time box of my activity that I created below:
<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Week 0</th>
    <th>Week 1</th>
    <th>Week 2</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>Installed VSCode</td>
    <td>Personalized my fastpages</td>
    <td>Created a Jupyter notebook post</td>
    <td>Used Github insights</td>
    <td>-</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Installed Bash and created a Bash notebook</td>
    <td>Wrote a personal blog post</td>
    <td>Created a Python quiz</td>
    <td>Uploaded own word document</td>
    <td>Added notes and vocab pages</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Dictionary/lists hacks</td>
    <td>Dark mode</td>
    <td>Changed theme to midnight and then reverted it</td>
    <td>Added some tables (including this one)</td>
    <td>Added to notes+vocab pages</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Hack #3: Naming/Tagging
I have incorporated naming and tagging into my fastpages blog because I have categories for hacks, posts, and setup. Here is an image that shows this.

### Hack #4: Search
I have considered the search feature because I name all my posts and notebooks with specific keywords and also tag them, so it is easy to find. Here is a screenshot of me utilizing the search feature.

  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Hack #6: Dark Mode
I have changed my site to dark mode, which you can see!
