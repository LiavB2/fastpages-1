### Period 1: AP Calc
I have been enjoying AP Calculus so far, but I think my class is a little bit boring because we aren't very talkative and sociable. The workload has been pretty easy so far, I have only spent maxium 10-20 minutes on the HW each night.

### Period 2: Honors Humanities
Honors humanities is pretty fun and I enjoy all our discussion about art and aesthetics, the workload has also been pretty easy. I like Mrs. Philyaw's energy in the classroom.

### Period 3: AP World History
This might be one of my favorite classes right now because I like the energy and atmosphere of the classroom. I also really like my teacher, Ms. Volger. We haven't gotten too deep into material yet though.

### Period 4: AP CSP
I have been enjoying APCSP so far because it is a chill period, and I enjoy the tasks that we do, such as making a blog and coding in Python.

### Period 5: AP Chem
I also enjoy AP Chem, and most of the work right now is review, but we are moving at a pretty fast pace. We did a paper chromatography lab on the first day in class, which I also liked.
