### Performance Task Plan
I want to create a productivity app that keeps track of what you need to do (todo list) and also your goals. It will have a bunch of functions too.

For every todo list item, I will record the following things:
- Name of task
- Description of task/goal
- Estimated time for completion
- Due date
- Urgency
- Category

For every goal, I will record the following things:
- Goal title
- Goal detailed description (action items)
- Goal due date
- Priority
- Category

These are the functions I plan to have:
1. Display the entire todo list.
    a. Filter todo list by soonest due date
    b. Filter todo list by urgency
    c. Filter todo list by estimated time for completion
    d. Filter todo list by category
2. Display all goals.
3. Display goal with highest priority

I will most likely code this in Python.

### How My Quiz Meets the CollegeBoard Requirements

#### Program Purpose and Function
The purpose of my program is to enhance the productivity of the user by providing them todo list and goal features. The user inputs everything they want to do and then my program provides them with different functionalities for output.

#### Data Abstraction
The todo list data and goal data will be stored in databases and lists.

#### Managing Complexity
The database and list will manage the complexity of the program because it is necessary for filtering and displaying.

#### Procedural Abstraction
I will create functions for filtering the data for the user to see, which is a procedural abstraction.

#### Algorithm Implementation
I will create functions for sequencing, selecting, and iterating for displaying the goals and todo lists, which satisfies this condition.

#### Testing
When the user interacts with the program, it will constantly call the functions I will code, which satisfies this requirement.

### AP Exam MCQ
I will prepare for the AP exam MCQ by taking adequate notes every week in my blog and also blogging my findings and discoveries. This way, I can just review all of these things in one place before the AP exam. This is time efficient becaues I don't need to search in many places.

I will also do some practice MCQs via CollegeBoard and other practice tests.

My idea for the performance create task is above.

### Sprint Backlog
<b>Here is my sprint backlog</b>
<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Educational Zones</th>
    <th>Interest/Fun Zones</th>
    <th>Blogging and Review Zones</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>Start looking at CollegeBoard videos and doing practice MCQs</td>
    <td>Code fun things that I want to do, such as the performance task</td>
    <td>Update my notes and vocab page each week with what I learned</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### What I Did This Week
This is a list of what I did this week.
- Created a [quiz](https://studio.code.org/projects/applab/V_oDt5yy_qq1Xr8AzGKbiO_LCN-sBTvUuMT7Y8u4p-I) using code.org
    - I did a five-question (more than the 3-question requirement!) quiz on food.
    - It tells you immediately after the question if you got it right or wrong, and then you can click to go to the next question.
    - At the end of the quiz, it shows your quiz score and percentage after! :) (not part of the requirements!)
- Drafted a plan for my Collegeboard Performance Task
    - I created an idea of what I want to do for my performance task. I described the purpose and functions of the performance task above.
- Created a plan of what I will do to study for the MCQ of AP exam.
