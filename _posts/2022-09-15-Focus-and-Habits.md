### Psychology and the Good Life Notes
Here are my notes from the video:


### Gratitude List
I am grateful for many things. Here are some:
- friends and family
- plentiful, healthy, and delicious food
- going to school and being able to learn
- the ability to move around and exercise
- going to social events and hanging out with people
- music that I can listen to in any mood

### Gratitude to my friend
Here is a gratitude message I sent to my friend:
"i just wanted to let you know how much you mean to me and thanks for being my best friend and staying with me no matter what :)"

### Gratitude to someone at home
Here is a gratitude I wrote to my mom:
"Thank you for being the very best mom to me! You are such an amazing person and I love you so much! Thanks for putting up with me for already 15 years, I can't even believe it :)"

### Goals
Here are some goals I want to set.
1. Studying and Academic - I want to be productive and study well. I don't want to get distracted and procrastinate when I'm working. I will take some short breaks, but I will get all my work done before doing other things.
2. Personal Life - I want to focus on myself as well. I want to do something that I enjoy doing at least once every day. That can be something as simple as reading or cooking, but I want to be able to enjoy everyday.
3. Reading - I want to read more because I'm a little busy nowadays, so I barely read anymore. This ties along with my first goal because if I'm more productive, I can have more time for my personal life and reading as well.

### My Personal Journey for Computer Science
I want to learn a lot in this APCSP class. I also want to join a coding club at school. Also, I want to learn some more coding, like Python and C++.
