Here, I will put notes about APCSP that I will collect throughout the year!


<h3>Week 1</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Grouping a sequence of commands, often used repeatedly, is called <b>procedural abstraction</b>.</li>
    <li>Bash is UNIX shell and command language. It is the default login shell for most Linux distributions.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Week 2</h3>
<ul>
    <li>List is used to collect many instances of a pattern</li>
    <li>Dictionary is used to define data patterns.</li>
    <li>Iteration is often used to process through lists.</li>
    <li>A for loop iterates through a code a certain number of times.</li>
    <li>A while loop continues to iterate through a block of code until a condition is false.</li>
    <li>A recursion loop calls itself repeatedly.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Week 3</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Creating performance task is very important, and I need to look at examples and the rubric to know exactly what I need to do.</li>
    <li><a href="https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/media/pdf/ap21-apc-computer-science-principles-create-performance-task-sample-a.pdf">Good Example A</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/media/pdf/ap21-apc-computer-science-principles-create-performance-task-sample-b.pdf">Good Example B</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/media/pdf/ap21-apc-computer-science-principles-create-performance-task-sample-i.pdf">Bad Example I</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/media/pdf/ap21-apc-computer-science-principles-create-performance-task-sample-h.pdf">Bad Example H</a></li>
    <li>Studying for the MCQ is very important, so I should take notes in one place.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Week 4</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Collaboration is important because it produces a computing innovation that reflects the diversity+talents+perspectives of the people who worked together to design it</li>
    <li>Flask is the Web Application Framework. Python will be the Backend Development languages. Jinja2 is the Web Template language, that work well with Flask and Python. HTML, CSS, JavaScript will support frontend work built into the Flask project.The external Fastpages/Github Pages project will use the Flask/Python project for backend services, like persistent data or databases (ie SQL).<li>
    <li>Docker can allow us to locally run our fastpages, so we can see changes immediately instead of pushing to GitHub and then waiting.</li>
</ul>
